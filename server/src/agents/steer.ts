/**
 * Mid-turn "steering" queue. The agent's pod is single-threaded — one
 * turn runs at a time — so a user message that arrives during a long
 * hop sequence used to be invisible until the turn finished and the
 * scheduler woke the agent again. For long-running turns (multi-step
 * tool calls, big diffs, slow LLM) that delay was felt as "the agent
 * isn't listening."
 *
 * Design — mirrors OpenAI Codex's steering pattern, adapted for our
 * Responses-API hop loop:
 *
 *  - **Inter-hop injection, not stream cancel.** New user messages
 *    arrive via the wake-bus as steer events and land in the queue
 *    here. The currently-running LLM stream + any in-flight tool
 *    call are NOT disturbed — they finish and write their
 *    `function_call` / `function_call_output` pair normally. At the
 *    hop boundary in turn.ts we drain this queue and append the
 *    steered items to history. Result: `function_call ↔
 *    function_call_output` pairing in history is never broken by
 *    construction.
 *  - **Auto-batching.** Per-message drains would let a busy group
 *    chat flood the context window. We hold incoming items in a
 *    fixed-window debounce buffer (DEBOUNCE_MS from the FIRST item;
 *    later items in the same window pile in but don't extend the
 *    deadline). The hop-loop's drain check returns false until the
 *    window elapses, so multiple messages naturally merge into one
 *    batch.
 *  - **Summarization threshold.** Small batches (≤
 *    SUMMARIZE_THRESHOLD raw items) are spliced verbatim — preserves
 *    nuance, no extra LLM cost. Larger batches go through the same
 *    cheap-model summarizer the auto-compaction path uses.
 *  - **Hard cap.** MAX_BATCHES_PER_TURN bounds the total number of
 *    steering injections per turn so an indefinite chat firefight
 *    can't blow the context. Excess steers stay in the messages
 *    table and get picked up by the next wake.
 *
 *  This module is **state-only** — pure functions over a module-level
 *  Map. Pure makes it directly unit-testable; module-level Map is
 *  fine because the agent pod is single-process and per-agent
 *  serialization is enforced by pod-agent.ts's drain mutex. The
 *  cumora-server uses the inproc runtime for tests where multiple
 *  agents share one process, but per-agent state still doesn't
 *  collide because each agentId gets its own bucket.

// immediately instead of waiting for the next natural hop boundary.

// ── why this queue is intentionally NOT persisted ──────────────────────
//
// The queue lives only in process memory. A pod crash mid-turn loses
// every in-flight steer. That sounds bad — but the design is correct:
//
// 1. Every steered message is ALREADY in the `messages` table
//    BEFORE the steer event publishes (the scheduler.wake() path
//    writes to DB first, then publishes). So the message is durable.
// 2. On pod restart, the pod's SSE re-attach kicks `void drain()`
//    unconditionally. drain() → runAgentTurn → loadInbox reads every
//    unread message via the conversation_reads cursor (which is also
//    in DB). Anything not yet processed surfaces; anything already
//    processed has its cursor advanced and is skipped.
// 3. So "lost queue" only loses the LATENCY OPTIMIZATION of mid-turn
//    injection. The message itself reaches the agent on the very next
//    turn — exactly as it would have pre-steering. Worst case: ~one
//    turn of extra latency, which is the steady-state for any agent
//    that wasn't actively running a turn anyway.
//
// Adding Redis persistence would:
//  - introduce a new failure mode (pod restart → replay of already-
//    consumed steers → potential duplicate processing if the cursor
//    update raced with the persist)
//  - require extra Redis I/O on every push (hot path)
//  - solve a problem that the inbox + cursor already self-heals
//
// If you find yourself wanting to add persistence here, first answer:
// "what user-visible outcome differs from the inbox-based recovery?"
// In our model the answer is "nothing observable" — and that means
// the right call is to NOT add the complexity.
