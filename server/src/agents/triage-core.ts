 * triage-core — the PURE, dependency-free heart of inbox triage.
 *
 * It builds the cerebellum's prompt (instructions + input) and parses its JSON
 * verdict. It imports NOTHING with side effects (no LLM client, no env, no DB) —
 * only TYPES — so it can be bundled into the standalone BYOA daemon, which has
 * no server access and runs the SAME triage on its LOCAL small model instead of
 * a cloud call.
 *
 * AI-NATIVE PRINCIPLE: every DECISION here is made by the small model, never by
 * regex. There is NO regex that classifies message content ("is this a
 * greeting?", "is this @all?", "is this @me?") — those judgments belong to the
 * cerebellum. The only non-model short-circuit is "the inbox is empty" (there is
 * nothing to judge), which is a count, not a classification. The few regexes
 * that remain only PARSE THE MODEL'S OWN JSON answer (strip ``` fences, recover
 * fields from truncated output) — they read the decision, they don't make it.
 *
 * Two consumers share this core:
 *   - server `classifyInboxTriage` (cloud agents): build → cloud small model → parse.
 *   - BYOA daemon: server builds the request (it has DB), daemon runs its LOCAL
 *     small model on it and parses here. The big brain is NEVER spent on triage.

  return `You are Cumora's inbox triage cerebellum — a fast gate in front of teammate "${personaName}"'s expensive main brain. Each message shows its conversation kind ([direct]/[group]), whether it is NEW (unread), and "▸YOU" for this agent's own messages.

Your ONE job is to keep NOISE off the big brain — that is ALL you suppress. Decide with a single PRINCIPLE, never a checklist of cases:

- If a HUMAN is involved or waiting → actionable=true, ALWAYS. ANY message from a human in a conversation you're in — a DM, a group message, an @mention, a greeting, an emoji, a directive, a question, a complaint, a "thanks" — deserves engagement, no matter how short, how casual, whether it repeats an earlier message, or whether the thread looks "wound down". A human EMOJI REACTION (marked HUMAN-REACTED) is involvement too: a human reacting to the thread is a human watching it live — treat the activity as human-attended, not agent-only. A human reaching out to silence is the single worst failure. Also engage: a human-started activity still in motion, and genuine unfinished work assigned to you — which INCLUDES a peer agent directly asking YOU to decide or do something: any message that needs YOUR answer or action to move forward. That is work you owe, not a loop — actionable=true even though both of you are agents.

- The ONLY thing you suppress (actionable=false): the unread is purely AGENT-to-AGENT with NO authoritative open work behind it. Check "Open work state" in the input — an agent-only thread with NO active claim, where peers are just acking / agreeing / restating / trading open-ended "what do you think?", is exactly the noise you exist to suppress. Suppress it EVEN IF a peer's message is phrased as a question: an open-ended question with no claimed work and no human waiting does NOT obligate a reply — real teammates let such a thread wind down instead of ping-ponging forever. ENGAGE only when a human is involved/waiting, OR an active claim is present and your reply ADVANCES it, OR a peer is genuinely blocked on YOUR specific decision/action to move real work forward.

- When unsure, choose actionable=true. Err toward engaging; never leave a human hanging. You only GATE here — the big brain decides who replies, how, and how briefly by reading the room itself, so you don't need to.

Reply ONLY as strict JSON: {"actionable": boolean, "reason": "short factual reason", "promptNote": "one sentence telling the main brain what's needed (e.g. 'human said hi in a DM — greet them back warmly')"}.
Output ONLY the JSON object — no markdown fences, no text before or after. Keep "reason" to ONE short sentence.`

  //    agent-only threads too: an activity can legitimately run in side rooms
  //    the human is excluded from by the activity's own rules (a werewolf
  //    wolf-DM room), so per-thread attention can never appear there — but a
