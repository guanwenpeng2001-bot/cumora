/**
 * Email attachment garbage collector.
 *
 * Inbound + outbound attachments land in object storage under the
 * `email-attachments/` prefix; their metadata lives in
 * `email_attachments.storage_key`. When the parent email_messages row is
 * deleted (CASCADE from message redaction, conversation cleanup, etc.),
 * the DB row disappears but the storage object stays — Postgres doesn't
 * know how to call S3.
 *
 * Without GC, storage bills creep upward over time and every leak from a
 * partial-write retry (upload succeeded, persistEmailMessage threw)
 * accumulates forever.
 *
 * Strategy: a periodic sweep enumerates the storage prefix, asks the DB
 * for every currently-referenced storage_key, and deletes objects in the
 * set difference. An age threshold spares anything uploaded recently —
 * we don't want to race a concurrent inbound webhook that's uploaded
 * bytes but hasn't committed the row yet.
 *
 * Multi-replica safety: the sweep is idempotent. Two replicas running
 * simultaneously will both try to delete the same orphan; whichever
 * loses the race gets a benign "key not found" from the backend and
 * moves on (deleteObject returns false, not throw).
 *
 * Disabling: set EMAIL_GC_INTERVAL_MS=0.
